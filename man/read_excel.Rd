\description{
A function to easily copy data into R from a spreadsheet.
             This should not be used within a reproducible work flow, instead
             it should only be used on an ad-hoc basis
             (note: I'm not aware of the original author of this function,
             it was taken directly from a stack overflow answer)
}
\examples{
# first copy data to clipboard (i.e. highlight data in spreadsheet and press ctrl + c)

# apply function to read data from clipboard into R

data = read_excel()
}
